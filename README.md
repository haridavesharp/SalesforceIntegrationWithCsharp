# Salesforce Integration with C# using .NET

This repository contains a C# application demonstrating Salesforce integration using .NET, along with corresponding unit tests.

## Overview

The project showcases a C# console application that authenticates with Salesforce and retrieves account information. Additionally, it includes unit tests to verify the Salesforce authentication process.

## Prerequisites
